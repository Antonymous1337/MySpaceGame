Finished ideas:
	Rotating asteroids based on hit location and angle
	Randomized astroid trajectories
	invincibility upon hitting and iFrames
	Recoil and screen shake from shooting
	Boulders movement and trajectory change on hit, and amount of change is based on boulder strength/size
	Particle effects on movement and boulder hit (boulder particles move based on shot trajectory and location of collision)
	Created paralax background
	Created astroid variation (way too mundane if just one type of asteroid)
	Looping room mechanic
	Fixed looping mechanic where player only loops when going left or up (now includes down and right)
	Created a basic enemy and made minor tweaks to make it fair
	Fixed paralax background from freaking out when moving too far in one direction
	Created script to help with object movement
	Changed bullets from a frame lifetime system to a pixel range system (easier to control)
	Converted bullets to have a speed and direction system instead of hsp and vsp system 
	Fixed asteroid from spinning in wrong direction when shot from the left side
	Tweaked Asteroid strength/size/speed ratios
	MAP - Press M to hide/show map, shows asteroids and enemies
	Created spawn limits
	Pivot points for big enemy (2 specific spots for shooting)
	Removed dependency on oPlayer instance on death
	Created beta menu
	Added $ for score, highscores are determined off of total $ gained, calculated in background
	Created overall spawn caps to aid with level seperation
	Level system (along with 5 levels, and an unpolished default level)
	Enemies now increase in hp the higher the level
	HP bars for both player and enemies (not asteroids)
	damage variable
	damage increase for enemies (NOT ASTEROIDS) as levels go up
	Create cool shaking mini-animation when player reaches next level
	Created coin system instead of automatic money system
	Created player gravity for coins
	Increase coin drops as levels increase
	Created first boss (boss body, map icon, small turret, big turret, and big bullets)
	Animated small turrets, big turrets, and big bullets
	Added knockback to big bullets
	Implemented boss to level system and added 4 more levels
	Added spawning script to help with code readability
	Improved enemy movement (every 3 seconds change destination to prevent grouping)
	Created a full currency system (way more than this project might ever actually need) (view list/map at bottom of log)
	Fixed coin spread and movement upon enemy death and coin spawning
	
Player has prompt to press spacebar (or to shoot) to start next level
Remove control from player and pause all movement upon upgrade screen

Enemies change trajectory after getting hit

Make sure to reset:
	Starting level
	Player damage

Player can only open upgrades during a safe space before starting next level (probably with space bar)
	
Multiple stages of boss attacks
Shoot cooldown decreases as boss health depletes (either in stages or smoothly)

Enemy bombs (shoot to explode or push)
small homing to make hitting enemies a little more fair/easy
Nerf base stats of enemies
Make hitbox of asteroids circular

Make child objects of boss to have a "parent id" variable so they become reusable

Make coins fly around more on bigger enemies such as bosses

Have player pushed out of big bullets
	

Perfect the transition

Boss and mini-boss icons for Map
Maybe small icon for bullets on map
	
Add next and goto to transition event

Create looping level mechanic (primarily meant for bosses, as bosses cycle)
	
Change spawner to set random x/y on spawner event and NOT in the asteroid object itself

Have a smarter enemy that shoots ahead of player

Home store costs same as in-game store, but home current increases at very slow rate (1:100 or 1:1000)

Tweak things for slow exponential growth rather than linear (both enemies and player upgrades alike)

Slow down movement
Bomb that removes everything on screen

Make map a 1 pixel sprite for small performance boost

increase width of walls in map, or find some way to stop drawing parts of the marker that go off the map

Direction-based movement (makes diagonal movement the same speed as cross movement)

Transition object

enemy hit particle effects
multiple layers of "cracking" in meteors to show damage (maybe something similar on enemy ships as well);
meteors spread when destroyed when strength is above a certain value

maybe a regenerating shield system

Lazers and Missles
	
Different enemy types

Bosses

Save/Load System

Maybe a mix of arcade and rogue-like (some form of currency and upgrades transfer between attempts)

Upgrades and multiple shoot types
Overheating effect
Overall upgrades

Save system
Save Encryption

Improve ship movement (make diagonals better) (speed and direction system instead of hsp/vsp system)
